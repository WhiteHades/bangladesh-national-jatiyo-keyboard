# Bangladesh National (jatiyo) Keyboard

A keyboard layout by the _Bangladesh Computer Council_ (BCC) on authority of the **Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh**.

*Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the BCC or the Government. Having searched for a 1st party layout for the [national layout](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/KB-Bengali-Jatiyo.svg/1200px-KB-Bengali-Jatiyo.svg.png) on Windows and failing to do so, I decided to make one from scratch using the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator.*

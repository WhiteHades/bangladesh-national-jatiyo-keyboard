# Bangladesh National (jatiyo) Keyboard

A keyboard layout by the _Bangladesh Computer Council_ (BCC) on authority of the **Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh**.

*Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the BCC or the Government. Having searched for a 1st party layout/keyboard for the [national layout](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/KB-Bengali-Jatiyo.svg/1200px-KB-Bengali-Jatiyo.svg.png) on Windows (and the internet) and failing to do so, I decided to make one from scratch using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator v1.4.*

## Important Points
- This keyboard is available only for windows.
- This is **not** a phonetic keyboard.
- This is installed directly onto the official *Bangla (Bangladesh)* language on Windows so make sure to add said language from the _language & region_ setting before installing it.
- It is encouraged to verify the `.exe` file on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) before proceeding to install for peace of mind.
